; All.ahk - every part of Daybook, in the order it loads
;================================================================================
; Daybook.ahk includes this file and nothing else. The order matters for the
; first three and only the first three: in AutoHotkey v1 a script RUNS from the
; top until it meets a Return or a key definition, so everything that has to
; happen at start-up has to come before anything that does not.
;
;   Config     the settings, read from Daybook.ini once - and the colours
;   State      every value the script keeps while it runs
;   Start      builds the windows, starts the timers, then Return
;   ----------- nothing below here runs on its own -----------------------------
;   Keys       Win+F6, Win+F1, and the clicks that only leave a timestamp
;   Timers     the four clocks, and the sit counter they drive
;   Presence   is anybody there: the display, the lock screen, sound, input
;   Bar        the sit timer as the bar across the top, and the digits
;   Log        which program was in front, and the day's totals
;   Tasks      adding, renaming and marking a task
;   Habits     the daily habits, their week of dots and their streaks
;   Day        when a day starts and what happens when it ends
;   Journal    writing to the markdown files - append only
;   Store      Daybook-state.txt, and the [Saved] part of Daybook.ini
;   Panel      building the panel, painting it, and how much of it shows
;   Break      a break you declared by hand
;   Modes      SOLID / DIM / GHOST, always on top, show and hide
;   Layout     where every section and row ends up
;   Events     what a click on any of it does
;   Capture    the box you type a new task into
;   Note       the box that opens beside a task you just marked
;   Review     yesterday's unfinished work, asked about one at a time
;   SettingsWin  the settings window
;   Tray       the tray icon's menu, and leaving tidily
;   Ini        the commented Daybook.ini written on the first run
;
; Last of all, Settings.ahk: the reader that turns Daybook.ini into values. It
; is all functions, so where it goes in the list does not matter.
