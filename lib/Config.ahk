; The settings you would ever want to change live in Daybook.ini next to this
; file, seeded with comments the first time the script runs. Tray menu >
; Settings is the way in (SettingsWin.ahk); every change there is written to
; that file and takes effect at once, and the window has a link at the bottom
; that opens the file itself, where the same settings carry their reasons.
; Ini.ahk holds what gets written on the first run. What is left in this section
; is layout arithmetic, which a stray number would break.
;
; Nothing in the .ini can stop the script from starting: a missing, blank or
; nonsense value falls back to the default written here.
; The full path, not just a name: CfgSeed would otherwise put the file beside
; Settings.ahk, which is in lib\. Settings belong next to the script.
