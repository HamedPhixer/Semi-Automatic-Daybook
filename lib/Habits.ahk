;================================================================================
; Habits - the things you want to keep doing, and how long you have kept it up
;================================================================================
; A habit is not a task. A task is done once and gone; a habit comes back
; whether you did it or not, and the thing worth showing is whether you have
; kept it going.
;
; Each row carries a week of dots and one number, and the DOTS ARE BUTTONS:
; click the one for Tuesday and Tuesday is ticked. That is the answer to
; forgetting, and it is why the dots are there rather than a bare streak.
;
;     [v] read 20 pages          . . o o o o o     12
;
; HOW OFTEN - every habit has a rule, and the streak is measured against it:
;   every day            the chain holds while no day goes by undone
;   every N days         ...while no N days in a row go by undone
;   N times a week       counted in WEEKS: a week is kept when it has N days
;                        done. Weeks start on Monday. The week you are in
;                        cannot break anything until it is over.
;
; REST DAYS are the exceptions to the rule - sick, away, a day off on purpose.
; A rest day does not break the chain and does not count towards it either,
; the way a streak freeze works: 12, rest, 13. In a week-counted habit it takes
; one off that week's target. There are only so many a month (RestPerMonth),
; or any streak could be kept forever.
;
; THE STREAK IS NEVER KEPT BY HAND. It, the best and the days-done count are
; all worked out from the history - the days done and the rest days - every
; time the history changes, by HabitCompute(). Nothing adds one or takes one
; away, so a tick taken back, a day filled in late, a week away with the PC off
; or a streak brought in from somewhere else all come out right by the same
; road. The whole history is kept, for the same reason: a streak longer than
; the history cannot be measured.
;
; IN OBSIDIAN - each day's note has the habits in Daybook's block, with the run
; each one had reached that day (DayBlock in Journal.ahk), and Daybook.md has the
; streaks and two weeks of them (Board.ahk). Ticking a day late rewrites that
; day's block, so the note never disagrees with the dots.
;================================================================================

; A habit's whole record. Nothing else creates one. kind "D" is every n days
; (n 1 is every day), "W" is n times a week.
