; The day note, and Daybook's own log - two different things, kept apart
;================================================================================
; THE DAY NOTE, YYYY-MM-DD.md in the journal folder, is for you: to read, and
; to write in. Daybook owns ONE part of it - a block between two markers at the
; bottom - and rewrites that block as the day goes: the tasks with their notes,
; the habits, the time at the machine. Everything outside the markers is yours
; and goes back exactly as it came out, so whatever you write above the block
; stays exactly as you wrote it. A new day's note opens with a "## my notes"
; heading waiting for you. See DayNoteWrite().
;
; The block is at the BOTTOM so that rewriting it can never move the text you
; are typing: everything above it stays where it is.
;
; THE LOG, log\YYYY-MM.txt beside the script, is every click as it happened -
; added, ticked, renamed, reopened, dropped. It is append-only and outside your
; vault: nobody reads it in the normal run of things, it is where to look when
; a number seems wrong. Journal() and JournalNote() write to it.
