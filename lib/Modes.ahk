; Always on top is what separates a panel from a window you have to go and find.
; Off, it drops behind whatever you click next and only surfaces when the
; desktop under it is clear - which is exactly the point on a busy screen, and
; exactly why it needs saying somewhere other than the window itself.

; Gui +/-AlwaysOnTop rather than WinSet: this changes the GUI's own option, so
; it survives the Gui,Show that every Relayout() ends with. A WinSet would be
; quietly undone the next time you opened a section.
;
; WS_EX_NOACTIVATE (0x08000000) moves with it, and that is the whole of
; "clicking it does not bring it forward". The flag says the window can never
; take focus, which is exactly right while the panel floats over your work - a
; readout must not steal the keyboard from a game or an editor - and exactly
; wrong once it is an ordinary window, because ACTIVATING is how a click raises
; a window. With the flag on, Windows refuses, and the only thing lifting the
; panel was the hand-rolled SetWindowPos in OnPanelClick - which the very next
; click on any other window put straight back. Dropping the flag along with
; always-on-top hands the job back to Windows, and the panel then behaves like
; every other window on the screen, every time and not just the first.
;
; Hover still works while it is off, and it works on the panel's RECTANGLE - so
; a panel buried under another window will still light up when your pointer
; crosses where it is. Nothing can be done about that without hit-testing every
; window above it, and it is a fair trade for the polling that makes GHOST mode
; possible at all.
