; The panel
;   WS_EX_NOACTIVATE, and there is no MsgBox anywhere in this file on purpose:
;   MsgBox is modal and steals focus, which is the single thing that makes a
;   tool like this unbearable to have running while you are in something else.
;
;   Rows are a fixed POOL of controls that get moved, recoloured and hidden.
;   AHK cannot destroy a control once it exists, so building a row per task
;   would leak controls all day. A pool also means a redraw is a few Move calls
;   instead of rebuilding a list.
