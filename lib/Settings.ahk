; Settings.ahk - the settings file every script reads, and how it reads it
;================================================================================
; #Include'd by MicControl.ahk, TTS.ahk, TimelapseRecorder.ahk, AudioSwitch.ahk,
; MonitorPower.ahk and Hub.ahk. It holds no settings of its own - it is the
; half-dozen functions they all need in order to have one.
;
; WHY THE SETTINGS LIVE IN A .INI AND NOT AT THE TOP OF EACH SCRIPT
;   They used to live at the top of each script, which meant changing one was
;   editing code: you had to find the right line among a thousand, get the
;   quoting right, and not break the file. Those scripts deliberately have no
;   "Edit Script" in their tray menu, so that was not even offered.
;
;   Now each script seeds a plain .ini next to itself the first time it runs,
;   with a comment above every setting saying what it does and what else it
;   will take, and its tray menu has one item that opens that file in Notepad.
;   Nothing in the .ini can stop a script from starting: a key that is missing,
;   blank, mistyped or nonsense falls back to the same default the script
;   shipped with. The worst a bad edit does is leave one setting at its default.
;
;   Vocab.ahk has worked this way for a while - this is the same idea, spread
;   to the rest, with the reading put in one place instead of six.
;
; TWO COPIES OF THIS FILE EXIST, and they are meant to be identical. Daybook is
; published on its own, so it cannot #Include a file from outside its folder -
; it carries its own copy at Daybook\lib\Settings.ahk. Change one and change
; the other, or the day they differ will be a long one. Not every script uses
; every reader here; a function with no caller in one copy is not dead code.
;
;
; WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* IN A .INI
;   Hotkeys. Almost every hotkey in these scripts is written as "#F2::" at the
;   top level, which AutoHotkey resolves when it LOADS the file - there is no
;   moment at which a string out of an .ini could be substituted in. Making
;   them configurable means rewriting each one as a Hotkey command plus a
;   label, and then a typo in the .ini becomes a runtime error at startup
;   instead of a setting that quietly falls back. The one exception is
;   MicControl's in-game key, which was ALREADY registered that way and so
;   costs nothing to expose - it is in MicControl.ini.
;
; READING RULES - the part worth knowing before you use these
;   A key that is ABSENT falls back to the default.
;   A key that is PRESENT BUT BLANK is an answer, not an absence, and CfgStr
;   hands the blank back. That distinction is the whole point of the Chr(1)
;   sentinel below: several settings use "" to mean something specific ("use
;   whatever Windows calls the default microphone", "never use a proxy"), and
;   a reader that turned a blank back into its default would make those
;   unsayable.
;   Numbers and switches have no such use for a blank, so for those a blank -
;   or anything unparseable - falls back to the default.
;
; A NOTE ON ENCODING, WHICH HAS BITTEN THIS FOLDER ONCE ALREADY
;   IniRead/IniWrite are Windows' own profile API. It understands two kinds of
;   file: UTF-16 with a BOM, and "bytes" (which for ASCII content is any of
;   ANSI / UTF-8-without-BOM). A UTF-8 file WITH a BOM is neither: the three
;   BOM bytes end up glued to the front of the first section name, so that
;   section becomes unreachable and the next IniWrite appends a SECOND section
;   with the same name underneath. MicControl.ini was in exactly that state.
;   So CfgSeed writes UTF-8-RAW - no BOM - and every template below is ASCII.
;================================================================================

; The folder these .ini files live in: the one THIS file is in.
;
; A_LineFile, not A_ScriptDir, and the difference matters. AudioSwitch.ahk and
; MonitorPower.ahk are #Include'd into Shortcuts.ahk, so A_ScriptDir means
; "wherever the script that started us lives" - the same folder today, and
; quietly not the same folder the day one of them is started from elsewhere.
; A_LineFile is always this file.
CfgDir() {
    return RegExReplace(A_LineFile, "\\[^\\]+$")

; CfgPath("MicControl") -> "...\MicControl.ini"
;
; A name that is already a path is handed straight back. Scripts that live in a
; folder of their own - Daybook - keep their .ini beside the SCRIPT rather than
; beside this file, and say so by passing the whole path.

; Write the commented default file, once, if it is not there. Returns the path

;
; Only ever called with a missing file, so it can never overwrite settings you
; have changed. A setting ADDED to a template later will not appear in an .ini
; that already exists - it simply falls back to its default, and the script
; goes on working. That is the trade for never touching a file you have edited.

; Like CfgStr, except a BLANK value falls back to the default as well.
;
; The two exist because a blank means opposite things depending on the setting.
; For a file path or a device name it means "I did not fill this in" and the
; default is what you want. For MonitorMic, Proxy, DefaultTarget and GameApps
; it means something specific and deliberate - "use whatever Windows calls the
; default", "never use a proxy", "every window" - and turning it back into the
; default would make those unsayable. Each setting picks the reader that
; matches what a blank means for it, and the .ini comment says which it is.
