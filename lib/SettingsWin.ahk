; SettingsWin.ahk - the settings window, tray menu > Settings
;================================================================================
; Every setting in Daybook.ini, in one dark window, saved as you change it and
; in force the moment it is saved. There is no OK button and nothing to apply:
; type 40 into "red after" and the bar is a 40-minute bar before you have let
; go of the key.
;
; The window is BUILT FROM A TABLE. SetupTable() lists every setting once - its
; section and key in the .ini, the variable it lives in while the script runs,
; its label, its unit and one line of help - and both the layout and the saving
; walk that same list. Adding a setting is one line there and one line in
; Ini.ahk; there is no third place to forget.
;
; It writes the .ini and sets the variable. It does NOT reread the file, so a
; value typed here and a value typed in Notepad arrive at the same place by
; different roads - which is why the file is still worth opening, and why "Edit
; Daybook.ini" is at the bottom of this window. The one difference: the file is
; read once, at start, so Notepad needs a reload and this does not.
;
; WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. The panel's palette, a dark title bar, and the yes/no
; switches are the panel's clickable words rather than real checkboxes - a
; Windows checkbox on a background this dark is a white square with a white
; tick in it, and reads as something that failed to load.
;
; The kinds a row can be:
;   head   a section title, no control
;   num    a number, with its unit beside it
;   bool   yes / no, clicked to swap
;   path   a folder or a file, the full width, with a picker beside it
;
; IT SCROLLS, and it has to: the table is meant to be added to, and a settings
; window that grows off the bottom of a laptop screen loses the settings at the
; bottom with no way to reach them. It opens as tall as its content or as tall
; as the screen has room for, whichever is less, and can be dragged taller and
; shorter - but only ever 620 wide, because the hints are written to that width.
; Scrolling is the real thing, bar and wheel both: SetupScrollTo moves every
; control at once with ScrollWindowEx rather than putting a child window inside
; a frame, which in v1 is far less to go wrong.
;
; The bar is PAINTED, not a Windows scrollbar - the same three-pixel strip the
; panel draws down its right margin, because the two windows belong to the same
; program and a grey system scrollbar in one of them says otherwise. It is
; drawn in SetupErase and dragged in SetupBarClick.
;================================================================================

; SetupHwnd, SetupBuilt and SetupRows are declared in State.ahk with everything
; else the script keeps, and for a reason worth knowing: a "global x := 1" in
; THIS file would be read as a declaration and never actually run, because
; every file below Start.ahk is past the Return that ends the auto-execute
; section. The variable would exist and be empty. The measurements below are
; locals inside SetupBuild() for the same reason.
