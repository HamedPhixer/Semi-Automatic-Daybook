;================================================================================
; Persistence - Daybook-state.txt, and keeping it safe
;================================================================================
; Everything that matters is in one plain-text file beside the script: the
; tasks and their notes, every habit with its WHOLE history and its rule, the
; finished days, the day's time. Everything else - the notes in Obsidian, the
; board - is written from it, and can be written again.
;
; So it is guarded the way Vocab guards words.json:
;
;   - A SAVE CANNOT LEAVE HALF A FILE. It is written to Daybook-state.txt.tmp,
;     read back and checked, and only then moved over the real one. A full
;     disk, a crash or a locked file mid-save leaves the old file whole, and
;     the save is tried again at the next change or minute.
;   - THE FILE SAYS WHERE IT ENDS. Its last line is "end" and the number of
;     lines before it, so one cut short - by a crash, or a sync that stopped
;     halfway - is known for what it is instead of being half read.
;   - A BACKUP A DAY. Before the first save of a day the file as it stood is
;     copied to backups\Daybook-state-YYYY-MM-DD.txt: each one is the state at
;     the end of the last day it changed. Kept: the newest 10, and the oldest
;     of each of the last 6 months. Restoring by hand is copying one over
;     Daybook-state.txt while Daybook is closed.
;   - A FILE THAT CANNOT BE READ IS NEVER SAVED OVER. It is moved aside as
;     Daybook-state.unreadable-<when>.txt, the newest backup that reads is
;     loaded in its place, and the tray says so.
