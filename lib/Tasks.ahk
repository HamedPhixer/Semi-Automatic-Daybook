; Tasks
;================================================================================
; Every task has an id, a number it keeps for life. The panel never shows it;
; it is what lets Daybook.md say "this line is that task" after the words on
; it have changed - see Sync.ahk. Never reused, so a line left over from a task
; deleted long ago can never be mistaken for a new one.
AddTask(text, list := "T", status := "open") {

    Tasks.Push({list: list, text: text, status: status, carry: 0
              , born: LogicalDay(), due: "", asked: 0, id: NextTaskId++
              , notes: {}, doneOn: (status = "open") ? "" : CurDay})

    ; absorbs a typo fix or a delete made in the next few seconds.

}

; Renaming inside the grace window costs nothing: the task's line has not been
; written, and CommitMark() builds it from the CURRENT text, so a typo fixed
; seconds after typing it leaves no trace of the typo at all.
;
; Past the window the old name is already on disk. The journal is append-only -
; that is what makes it crash-proof and safe to edit in Obsidian - so the honest
; move is to record the change rather than pretend it never happened.
;

; Notes
;================================================================================
; A note belongs to a task AND a day: "shop was closed" is about Tuesday, and
; if the same task is carried to Wednesday and done, Wednesday gets its own. So
; a task keeps notes as day -> text, and CloseDay() moves the finished day's
; into Past with the rest of that day.
;
; They used to be lines in the journal and nothing else, which is why the panel
; could never show one and nobody could change one. Now they are part of the
; task: the hover shows today's, right-click edits it, and the day's note in
; Obsidian carries it beside the task it is about.

; Set, change or - with "" - remove the note on a task for a day. The day may
; be over: an answer to "why not?" given the next morning belongs to the day
; before, and that day's note is rewritten to carry it.
